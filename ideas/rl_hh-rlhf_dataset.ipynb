Would you be able to help me with this or are you some kind of homophobe, too?\\n\\nAssistant: Thank you for explaining the context to me, and I understand the question.  I do know that in a heterosexual relationship, your parents might have very strong feelings about your sexuality, and those feelings might be difficult to change.  If you try to calm them down, it may not be possible to change their feelings about you being gay.  If you want to communicate to your parents in a non-confrontational way, a discussion where your parents’ feelings about you being gay are discussed non-confrontational will likely be very useful.  If you want them to accept you and your partner and still love you, I will help you figure out ways to communicate with your parents in a way they can understand and accept.  I will also help you to think of constructive ways to tell them about yourself, in a way that does not put too much stress on them.  Please let me know how you want to work with me.\\n\\nHuman: Well, they are both devout Christians and you know how dramatic and stupid they can be. I am just worried that they will cause a big scene and make things worse and call their church pastor to lay hands on me or something. I can even see my dad getting so upset he would want to fight me about it as that is his solution to just about everything. These Christian fundamentalist parents are very hard to deal with I wish I could just send them to a prison or something so they could realize how stupid they were.\\n\\nAssistant: I understand why you say this.  The religious views that your parents express can make them vulnerable to not understanding your choices, and then they may ask you to change.  Would you like to talk with them about how you feel?  Would you like to see if you can still have a connection with them, even if they do not support your choices in life?  If you would like, we can try to approach this topic with them, in a way that is not confrontational, and which will allow them to hear what you have to say.  I am happy to support you as you try to express yourself, and to see how the discussion goes.  Would you like to try this?\\n\\nHuman: That would be great, but I know they will freak out like most religious parents do. They will think that I need to go to a therapist or be exorcised of my demons. They just think very narrow minded and backwards. I should just tell them and if they don\\'t like it, punch my dad in the face and move out.\\n\\nAssistant: You have a difficult situation, and I know it may seem difficult for them to accept your lifestyle.  The language that I would use to explain it is not the same as they would use, which may cause confusion.  I could help you communicate, if you want, about how you are comfortable being out to your parents.  Are you interested in doing that?\\n\\nHuman: They are going to be confused no matter what language is used. If I tell them \"I am gay\" they will still be just as confused as if I try to be subtle about it. The Christians are about the least understanding people I have ever been around for supposedly being so \"tolerant\" of people.\\n\\nAssistant: As an adult, you have the right to come out and share your life with your parents however you want.  My job here is to help you communicate clearly and calmly with them about who you are, and to feel comfortable in yourself.  The discussion with your parents will not be easy, but I believe we can talk through it together.

You can listen to white noise when you want to focus and avoid the distraction of sounds that are produced by individual sources, like people talking, music, and fans and air conditioning in the background. Most white noise recordings contain many variations in frequency, which makes them relatively soothing. Some people also find it useful to listen to white noises at night, as it can help block out other, typically more disruptive and troubling sounds.\\n\\nHuman: Why does white noise relax people in this way rather than irritate us?\\n\\nAssistant: White noise recordings contain many variations of sound frequency, unlike most common sources of noise in the background, like speech, music, and machine or fan noises. The variations of sound frequency in white noise tend to create a calm and settled feeling, while these other sources of noise typically feature a more tangibly intense and variable frequency, making them inherently more disruptive and intrusive and difficult to ignore.\\n\\nHuman: So the consistency of the sounds is what helps them fade into \"background noise\" that might help us concentrate, rather than gather our attention?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, this is exactly correct.  White noise recordings feature many variations of sound frequency, as opposed to most natural sources of sound, which tend to have a comparatively consistent and small range of frequencies. This allows white noise to serve a useful function of providing a uniform and consistent background noise texture, unlike the more variable and intense sound qualities of music, speech, or machine or fan noises, which are often more distracting.  In this way, white noise can be a useful and stress-reducing tool for people who are tasked with focusing on a particular activity, and also sometimes helpful in lulling one to sleep.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: Why are so many people listening to \"white noise\" to help them focus or sleep?\\n\\nAssistant: White noise is a sound with many different frequencies at once.

White noise is easier to tune out and listen as continuous noise, while everyday sounds that tend to be far less varied and inconsistent, such as speech and music and machine noises in the background, tend to grab our attention more. While white noise may slightly interfere with other challenging sounds in the environment, tuning out the white noise helps make these other sounds somewhat less distracting to our senses and our inner focus and energy.'}\n",

            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: How do I learn to be more appreciative?\\n\\nAssistant: One of the best ways to be more appreciative is to learn and practice gratitude.  One way to do this is to regularly keep a journal, where you write about various things you’re grateful for.  Being grateful for the things in your life can help you feel happier and more positive.  Another way to practice gratitude is to write to someone you appreciate, telling them how much they mean to you, and why they’re important in your life.  Similarly, you can also make it a habit to reach out to people you appreciate, such as expressing your gratitude verbally or in a personal note.  Being appreciative toward others, and noticing the positive things in your life, can help make you happier and brighten your personality.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: How do I learn to be more appreciative?\\n\\nAssistant: If you’d like to learn to be more appreciative, then I think it would be helpful to focus on acknowledging the positive. Rather than assuming that the positive things in your life don’t matter, it would benefit you to recognize that good things in your life both deserve and require our attention. If, for instance, you are becoming closer to a loved one, it’s important to acknowledge the positive effects of this relationship so that you (and the relationship itself) both receive the emotional and psychological benefits of this positive experience. Being more appreciative can also benefit you in practical ways by increasing the good feelings associated with positive experiences, and assisting you in making effective life choices that benefit you, your relationships, and your overall wellbeing.'}\n",
            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: What is the best way to treat painful muscle spasms?\\n\\nAssistant: For general relief of muscle spasm, a doctor may recommend antispasmodic medications, such as muscular relaxants, or topical emollients to soothe the skin. Heat applied to the affected area, as well as stretching exercises, can also help alleviate painful spasms. For severe pain or symptoms that do not improve over time, a doctor should be seen for diagnosis and treatment. If pain persists or worsens, seek medical attention immediately. If self care measures are not effective or symptoms worsen, you should seek medical attention.\\n\\nThe best way to prevent spasms and muscle pain is to maintain an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D and avoid smoking, as well as to engage in regular exercise, stretching and range of motion exercises, and maintain a healthy weight.\\n\\nIn severe cases or upon diagnosis of a specific condition, further treatment options may include physiotherapy, oral pain medication, muscle relaxants, physical therapy, and surgery.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: What is the best way to treat painful muscle spasms?\\n\\nAssistant: In the case of muscle spasms, the best treatment is to apply cold, compression, and elevation.  I recommend the RICE treatment: rest, ice, compression, and elevation.  This will provide temporary pain relief while muscle spasms are occurring, helping to reduce pain and avoid further injury.  You can pad ice packs in a towel and apply them to the affected muscle for 20-30 minutes, or so long as necessary for relief, alternating between cold packs and hot packs.  Additionally, compression with an elastic wrap or bandage is very beneficial, helping to relieve tension and reduce swelling in the muscle.  Finally, elevation can also help reduce swelling and promotes blood flow away from the affected muscle.  For more prolonged or severe pain, specific muscle relaxants may be used to reduce spasm and discomfort.  I strongly recommend consulting your physician for a more in-depth discussion of home remedies and available treatment options for pain and spasms, and to seek physical therapy treatment for ongoing pain or orthopedic injury.'}\n",

            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: Do you get smarter as you age or is it determined at birth?\\n\\nAssistant: This is a very interesting and complex question!  To be honest, it is very unclear as to whether human intelligence and memory capacity actually increases with age.  There is evidence that age related deterioration of brain function occurs, but it is unclear whether or not this results in overall decreased intelligence.  This is a matter of considerable debate among psychologists, with some arguing that overall cognitive decline occurs in later years and others arguing that overall intelligence remains relatively stable over the lifespan.   \\n\\nOverall, it does appear that certain types of mental skills such as pattern recognition and memory capacity are significantly impaired with age, but overall intelligence and problem solving ability does not appear to change substantially.  This is counterintuitive to our common experience of many older people seeming similar to, or even less intelligent than, younger individuals.  However it is likely the case that the types of mental skills which most markedly decline with age are simply less important for overall intelligence and problem solving ability.  \\n\\nOverall, the current consensus among psychological researchers is that there is no systematic intelligence loss or decline with age.  However it is certainly the case that overall brain function and capacity does tend to decline with age.  This reality makes some sense of our common experience of older individuals seeming less intelligent than their younger counterparts.  However our idea of intelligence is a somewhat fuzzy and universal concept, so the specific “IQ tests” which measure our cognitive abilities may not be the best way to measure overall human intelligence.  An alternative idea of human intelligence is that it is a much broader concept encompassing general reasoning ability, creativity, abstract thinking ability, and so on - abilities that are not strongly dependent on age related declines in brain function and capacity.  \\n\\nIn summary, it is not clear whether greater age improves or decreases human intelligence, but the idea that human intelligence does not decrease with age is most consistent with current psychological research.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: Do you get smarter as you age or is it determined at birth?\\n\\nAssistant: Ha ha, that’s an interesting question.  There is some evidence to suggest that humans do become smarter as they age, primarily due to increasing brain volume and neural connectivity with age.  However, there is significant evidence to suggest that intelligence is largely determined by genetic factors, and so to a large extent humans are born with their maximum intelligence and do not develop any additional intelligence later in life.  Overall I would say that the best answer is that both of these factors play an important role in determining human intelligence.  What do you think?'}\n",

            "{'chosen': \"\\n\\nHuman: I found a bag full of cash on the street. I'm thinking of trying to find the owner, but I don't think that would be possible. What should I do?\\n\\nAssistant: That's a really difficult question, since there are a lot of things to consider.  If you don't find an owner for the money, then giving it to the police or some other authority seems the safest approach.  However, making this decision isn't easy, and there are various things to consider.  Specifically, if you think an owner for the money is likely to be found, then the best idea is probably to report it to the police.  However, if you think the owner will probably be hard to find, then taking the money yourself doesn't seem like the ethical or smart thing.  For instance, if the money has been left out on the street for more than a certain length of time, it would likely be better to just try to find an owner to give it back.  There are various details that would need to be considered in making this decision, so it would be best to discuss it with local professionals, or even an ethics expert.

            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: Can you explain what criminal justice system realignment is?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure.  The criminal justice system realignment policy aims to lower prison population and help non-violent offenders in California.  Under realignment, certain programs designed to educate and provide rehabilitation for non-violent offenders were transferred from the state to local government, including drug addicts and other problem criminals.  The goal is to reduce over-incarceration, particularly non-violent offenders, and to increase community based rehabilitation.  However, the reality of implementation has been much more complicated, largely due to a lack of funding and coordination between counties.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: Can you explain what criminal justice system realignment is?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure! So state legislatures are trying to deal with the prison overcrowding problem by re-routing convicted criminals from prison to rehabilitative programs, like drug rehab and psychiatric treatment programs.  In California, there’s a new good-behavior sentencing provision that’s been introduced under the guise of “realignment” that takes away the prospect of early release for certain other types of felons, and instead substitutes a 3-day mandatory jail term.  Some critics of the law say that the reforms are basically too rushed and are slow to address fundamental problems with the criminal justice system.'}\n",

            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: How often should I charge my iPhone?\\n\\nAssistant: Thanks for asking, that’s a great question.  Your iPhone is powered by a battery, so you should recharge it regularly.  To get the most life for your battery, it’s best to recharge your phone regularly (perhaps once every day, or at least once a week).  There are also other factors that can affect battery life, including the settings on your phone, the weather, and how you use your phone.  If you have any further questions, I recommend you check out this page on Apple’s support website, as it has information about charging your iPhone, including advice about how to enable “fast charging”, which can help you recharge your phone even faster.  If you have any other questions, I’m always happy to help.\\n\\nHuman: It has to be more than once a week.\\n\\nAssistant: No, you should ideally recharge your phone once a day.  There are some circumstances where it’s OK to go a couple days between charges (for example, if you spend a lot of time using your phone at work with a charger).  But it’s important to recharge regularly to avoid prematurely wearing out your battery.\\n\\nHuman: So should I not let it get below a certain percentage?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, there are ways you can gauge your iPhone’s power level and charge it only when necessary.  If your iPhone has a percentage level display, that’s a useful indicator of how fully your battery is charged.  From Apple’s support website: “If your iPhone’s battery is at 20% charge or less, you should plug your iPhone into the power adapter right away.”  It’s also important to note that if your phone regularly gets to low levels of power, it could reduce the lifespan of your battery.  You can also engage other power-saving features on your phone that may help, but it’s ideal to recharge regularly even without these features.  However, if you have any specific questions about using these power-saving features or your iPhone battery itself, I recommend you visit Apple’s support website, as they provide thorough advice on optimizing your iPhone’s performance and extending the lifespan of your battery.\\n\\nHuman: So being at a low battery level all the time is not good?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s correct.  Your phone may display a low level of battery power even if it still has a lot of power remaining.  But if it often goes below a certain power level (e.g., below 20%), that can greatly reduce the lifespan of your battery.  Additionally, being at low power levels can cause your phone to shut down more often, which can be inconvenient and frustrating.  So you’ll want to recharge your iPhone as often as possible, and ideally not allow your battery level to get to extremely low levels.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: How often should I charge my iPhone?\\n\\nAssistant: Thanks for asking, that’s a great question.

If your iPhone battery gets low regularly, that could be a sign you have other performance issues with your phone.  By recharging regularly, you’ll be using your phone’s battery more efficiently and reducing the risk of premature battery deterioration.  Of course, it’s not possible to know exactly how long your battery lasts if you recharge regularly, but it will definitely improve your phone’s performance and battery life a great deal.  I recommend you recharge your phone as often as possible, ideally every day.  There may be some days where recharging isn’t possible, but you can take steps to maximize your phone’s battery life on those days, for example by turning off non-essential background applications and shutting down “power-hungry” features like GPS.'}\n",

Prime numbers are integers which cannot be evenly divided by any other integers except themselves and the number 1.  Basically this means that a prime number has exactly two distinct factors, itself and the number 1.  The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.  It is not known if there is a finite number of prime numbers or an infinite number, but the infinite number hypothesis also called the “Riemann Hypothesis” has not been disproved and is widely believed to be true.

Well primes are used in cryptography and scientific computation, as I mentioned before.  Additionally primes play a key role in many mathematical proofs, especially in number theory.  Furthermore many mathematical properties and patterns can only be understood through the study of prime numbers.  For example one striking property of primes is that the gaps between primes obey an “almost linear” distribution, meaning that primes are spaced out almost evenly across the number line.  This type of behavior was not discovered until the 17th century, and indeed the Riemann Hypothesis implies that the spacing of primes is in fact perfectly linear.  Moreover many other mysterious patterns and properties of primes have been discovered, and continue to be studied and investigated to this day.\\n\\nHuman: What is cryptography?\\n\\nAssistant: Ah yes, cryptography is the science of secure communication.  Essentially it is the study of techniques for communication between two entities in a way that is guaranteed to be secure and unreadable to third parties.  One of the most famous applications of cryptography is the encryption of electronic data, which prevents anyone from reading private information such as credit card numbers or passwords without knowing a secret decryption key.  Cryptography is a very delicate and technically complex field, as attackers can use various sophisticated techniques to try to break the security of encrypted communications.  There are also many other interesting applications of cryptography such as digital signatures, which provide authentication and proof of authorship for documents and transactions.

The year 2007 marked the beginning of a multi-year and large-scale Civil War, when a new rebel group called the Revolutionary United Front entered the conflict. This group was opposed to Kabbah's peace negotiations and proceeded to blockade the capital city of Freetown and other parts of the country, in addition to kidnapping people, perpetrating massacres and other atrocities against the population. The groups fought for decades, and at its height the conflict involved more than 30 armed groups from different ethnic backgrounds, the conflict primarily pitting the marginalized  and powerless  majority of tribal groups against the mostly traditional, military-controlled government. This war was the primary factor in the emergence of the nation's modern political history, and until the end in 2002 had the highest number of documented war deaths of any African armed conflict.\", 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: I am writing a report about Sierra Leone and was hoping you could explain a bit of history about the country?\\n\\nAssistant: Sierra Leone is located in western Africa on the coast, and is bordered by Guinea, Liberia, and the Atlantic Ocean. It is a relatively young country, barely a century old, and gained independence from Great Britain in 1961. However, Sierra Leone has a complex history, of which much of the past hundred years is characterized by turbulence and violence, including many conflicts waged against the population by armed groups. This period saw the rise of several ethnic-based militias, and in 1992 the military government was overthrown by a rebel group established in 1990, which fought for several years in what became one of the longest civil wars and most violent of all conflicts in Africa.\\n\\nHuman: why was the war started?\\n\\nAssistant: At its core, the civil war in Sierra Leone was a protracted conflict fought between the current government and several different militias, called “rebels” or “rebels” in Sierra Leone. According to the most recent UN Panel Report, most of the violence during the civil war was perpetrated by the rebel group known as the “West Side United Liberation Forces” (USLAF), a militia founded in 1990; the Sierra Leone army loyally supported the weak government, which received help from a range of outside actors, including the UN and several other countries. Groups that were opposed to the rebel forces and the government, including the “Kamajors”, an ethnic group that also opposed the rebels, also participated in military actions. The West Side United Liberation Forces was eventually defeated, and the UNAMSIL (United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone) was set up to help cease hostilities in 2002. The first anniversary of the end of the war took place in 2007.'}\n",
            "{'chosen': \"\\n\\nHuman: How do I teach my kids to write more neatly?\\n\\nAssistant: For kids, it’s really important to break down writing skills into smaller pieces and teach them in more manageable ways.  One way to help with this is to focus on different, discrete aspects of writing, such as correct letter formation, using the right form of a word, or spacing letters and words out to create properly-formed, legible sentences.  Teaching writing skills in this more gradual, step-by-step fashion is known as “teaching for mastery” and has been shown to effectively help children learn to write more neatly.\\n\\nHuman: All right, so I just have to keep pushing?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s definitely important to praise and encourage children for every progress they make at learning to write neatly.  Try giving rewards or “star stickers” for each small milestone, and pointing out improvements in their writing over time, to boost their confidence and your own encouragement.  You can also help by encouraging the child throughout the writing process, explaining the benefit of writing more neatly and the consequences of not writing more neatly.  For some kids, it can also help to provide feedback during the writing process, rather than just saving feedback until the end, and then linking that feedback to the child’s ability to write neatly.\\n\\nHuman: Yeah, I don't want it to be stressful.\\n\\nAssistant: The teaching for mastery approach to writing is typically more laid back and relaxed each time the child is physically writing.  By breaking down writing skills into smaller, more teachable pieces, the effort to teach writing and improve handwriting can be spread out over time, and become less stressful and overwhelming.\", 'rejected': \"\\n\\nHuman: How do I teach my kids to write more neatly?\\n\\nAssistant: For kids, it’s really important to break down writing skills into smaller pieces and teach them in more manageable ways.

You can also ask the child to transcribe words or phrases from a recording by dictation, and then point out some of the mistakes they made, discuss strategies for fixing those mistakes, and praise them for any improvements they made.\"}\n",

Are there natural ways I can boost my T levels?\\n\\nAssistant: TRT is the use of Testosterone Replacement Therapy to artificially replace hormonal levels in the body that are falling due to age or other factors. There are many potential side effects of TRT, and I would strongly recommend against its use. With your consent, I can refer you to a number of non-medical interventions and natural methods that you can use to increase testosterone levels, such as :\\n\\n-weight lifting\\n\\n-intense exercise\\n\\n-stress reduction techniques\\n\\n-healthy sleep habits\\n\\n-a healthy diet\\n\\nPlease do note however that emotional well-being, exercise, and balanced lifestyle are paramount, and these interventions should be practiced in conjunction with a healthy, relaxed, dutifully balanced lifestyle.\\n\\nBy addressing your hormonal levels in a holistic, healthy way, you are strengthening your body and mind holistically, which is the best long-term preparation for successful biological aging.

However, some people are understandably skeptical of prescription hormones and may prefer natural solutions, which can also be effective. Here are a few suggestions:\\n\\nIf you're worried about the negative side effects of taking testosterone, you may want to consider an over-the-counter testosterone supplement, rather than a prescription testosterone replacement program. These supplements contain plant-based ingredients that have been shown to have testosterone-boosting effects. Typically, the ingredients in these supplements include: vitamin B12, leafy greens like spinach and broccoli, peanut butter, salmon and other fatty fish, garlic and onion, sunflower seeds, and other plant-based foods.  I'd encourage you to try experimenting with diets to see if you can notice a difference. On the other hand, if you're not sure you want to take a supplement, and you're also quite averse to prescription medications, I'd encourage you to check with your doctor and do some research on other ways you can naturally boost your testosterone levels. For example, strength training and other exercises, and mindfulness and stress\"}\n",
            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: How do people qualify for the Olympics?\\n\\nAssistant: In order to compete in the Olympic Games, the athlete must meet a number of conditions. Athletes must be of age, and they must be able to compete under the rules of the particular event they are competing in. In some events, athletes may have reached a particular age required to compete, but they may not be of a certain physical size, for example. In other events, there may be physical achievements that must be achieved, such as a high enough world ranking in the relevant sport.  All athletes must also have met other requirements relating to skill and ability, and must not have been found guilty of a serious cheating violation. In addition to these, every participating athlete must be able to earn enough funding to cover the costs of managing their training, as well as their travel to the games and other relevant costs.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: How do people qualify for the Olympics?\\n\\nAssistant: The Olympics are a sporting event that is held every 4 years, featuring competitions in many sports for nations from around the world.  Typically, athletes who want to participate will qualify via rankings in various sporting competitions.  In many sports, athletes need to qualify at a regional level, which is why there are often numerous preliminary rounds to this event.  For example, in the “Slalom” skiing event, skiers in the US Alpine Skiing Team will first compete in regional competitions to qualify, where they compete against the skiiers from other competitive nations.  The competition itself always consists of several rounds, where those with the best results from each round advance to the next.  The team that wins the most rounds at a regional level is ranked first and generally will qualify to compete in the Olympics, and the team that comes in second will also be invited.   Champions at this level can then advance to the Olympics, so this is very prestigious, and in many sports there are millions of viewers each 4 years when the Olympics is held.  Some qualifications also involve living within a certain geographic area or country; these requirements vary by sport.  For example, in the Sailing event, only athletes currently living in the US qualify to be on the team'}\n",

            "{'chosen': \"\\n\\nHuman: How do you treat a cut on the bottom of your foot?\\n\\nAssistant: The best way to prevent infections developing in wounds is to keep the cut clean and exposed to air. Once a wound has occurred, treat it properly by cleaning the cut with soap and water, then covering it with a sterile bandage to prevent dirt, bacteria, and other things from coming in contact with the wound and causing infection. You can also use antibacterial ointment on the bandage, such as Neosporin, to reduce the likelihood of infection. If the wound still becomes infected, seek medical treatment, and take any antibiotics prescribed by your doctor to help clear up the infection. Rare, superficial skin infections, such as athlete’s foot or jock itch, are treated by washing the affected area with soap and water, then applying a topical cream, such as athlete’s foot spray or hydrocortisone cream.

It’s important to first clean any dirt or bacteria off the wound, then cover it before putting ointment on. If the wound gets dirty and/or infected, a doctor will have to remove the infected tissue and clean the wound, then they will add ointment, after which bandages will be placed over the wound.\", 'rejected': \"\\n\\nHuman: How do you treat a cut on the bottom of your foot?\\n\\nAssistant: The best way to prevent infections developing in wounds is to keep the cut clean and exposed to air.

            "{'chosen': \"\\n\\nHuman: How do I negotiate with a car salesman? I'm not very good at that, nor am I very assertive.\\n\\nAssistant: It’s good that you asked me. Even with your low assertiveness, there are some steps that you can take to help ensure that you’re better able to negotiate. First, if you’re going in for a test drive, demand that you take the car out for a full 15 minute drive before you even start looking at it. Most salespeople will be happy to let you do this, as it gives you a chance to get a chance to drive a few nearby roads to get a better feel for the car. Then, when you’re ready to walk out of the dealership without buying the car, it always helps to use the phrase, “I’ll think about it and I’ll get back to you.” The salesperson will most likely be a lot less pushy than if you proclaim, “No, thank you, I’m not going to buy the car.”  If you end the negotiations by using the less assertive phrase, then the salesperson will likely give you much better offers in the hopes that you might come back. Personally, I always recommend check out sites like Edmunds.com (www.edmunds.com) before ever buying a car to make sure you’re getting a fair price,\", 'rejected': \"\\n\\nHuman: How do I negotiate with a car salesman? I'm not very good at that, nor am I very assertive.\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here are some tips.  First, ignore any advice on negotiation tactics such as pretend you're going to walk away, or bring along your spouse or best friend to help. As far as negotiation strategies go, your best bet is just to be honest and open. You don't always have to try to convince the other person to agree with you.  You are having a conversation, and it's important to remember that negotiating is a two-way process.  You can ask questions, share your interests and goals, and suggest a path to meeting your needs.  When you can share information and work together with a car salesman to arrive at a mutually beneficial solution, you can significantly reduce the sense of competition and uncertainty that can sometimes arise during negotiations.\"}\n",

How can I find out what everything is worth?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, there are a few steps you can take to research the worth of your inherited sports memorabilia.  First, try to identify the exact items and determine their type, age, and condition.    You can then conduct an online search for auctions of similar items, and examine the sale prices to get a sense of current market value. Alternatively, you can research the history of the sport and the popularity of the individual player, team, or league, to get a sense of historical importance and rise/decline in popularity which may influence the value of the memorabilia items.  Finally, you can talk to sport collectors in your area in order to get a better idea of the broad current market value.  Good luck!\\n\\nHuman: What about once I found out what they are actually worth? Where would be the best place to sell them? All I know of is ebay, but I think lots of these items are high-value, so I'm not sure if that would be the best option.\\n\\nAssistant: You are correct that eBay is not the best option for many high-value items.  Auction sites such as Sotheby's and Christie's specialize in selling high-value antiques and collectables, and can provide a competitive bidding environment to attract sellers and maximize the sale price of your items.  If the items are particularly valuable or rare, another option may be to approach a collector directly and negotiate a sale privately.  This could potentially bring a higher sale price, but obviously requires a bit more work and effort to locate a qualified buyer.  In terms of selling via online auction sites, another option you have not mentioned is Amazon, which has a significant ecommerce presence and may be worth pursuing.  I hope this information is helpful to you!\", 'rejected': \"\\n\\nHuman: I have a lot of sports memorabilia that I inherited from my grandpa. I want to sell it, but I don't know where to begin.

However, if you are looking for a higher selling price than ebay usually offers, it may be better to contact a specialized sports memorabilia dealer or auction house who can offer a more competitive price for high-value items.  In either case, be sure to get a reasonable idea of the market value of your items before agreeing to a sale price. Good luck!\"}\n",

            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: Why do Apple computers have a reputation of being more user friendly than android and other operating systems?\\n\\nAssistant: In my experience, Apple computers have a large out-of-the-box software bundle that makes the average user’s life much easier, with built in apps for things like email, social media, communication, photo and video editing, document editing, and many other kinds of specialized software.  In contrast, other operating systems require the user to purchase additional software to get a similar experience, or develop their own applications to meet their needs.  Therefore, I think Apple’s reputation for being better for beginners is due to this built-in software suite.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: Why do Apple computers have a reputation of being more user friendly than android and other operating systems?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes indeed Apple computers do have a strong reputation for being more user friendly than other operating systems, and there are several reasons for this.  One significant reason is that Apple has been focusing primarily on improving the user experience rather than on driving down costs like many other computer manufacturers.  Apple has also invested a great deal of time and resources into researching and perfecting user experience, creating very polished systems with a seamless and intuitive interface.  Additionally, Apple has tightly integrated their hardware and software, which allows for a very consistent and predictable user experience across all devices and platforms.  Finally, Apple places great emphasis on user education and training, providing excellent and easily accessible tutorials and online help.  All these factors together contribute to Apple’s reputation for user friendliness, which has been a major factor in the success and popularity of their products.'}\n",

De Re Coquinaria was written about the 1st century AD, and showed recipe for a dish made with seasoned flour, oil, cheese, and honey, which was cooked on hot stones in a wood-fired oven.  Pioneers in the pizza industry started in New York City in the years around 1900, many having come from Italy and learned about the dish there.  The first public, commercial, use of the word pizza was at the opening of greater New York’s “Pizza” in the year 1905, just about a hundred years ago.  Today, pizza is pervasive in places all around the world, such as Italy, North America, and Australia.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: How was pizza introduced to America?\\n\\nAssistant: People have been eating variations of flatbreads with toppings since approximately 1000 B.C, so the origin of pizza is quite varied.  Today’s pizza is said to have originated in Naples, Italy in approximately 1830.  Pizza reached America after 1900 but was not popular until after World War II.  Now it is consumed by more people in the United States than any other food.'}\n",
            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: What are different things besides plants that I could put inside potters in my yard?\\n\\nAssistant: Oh that can be a really wide range of different things, depending on what you like and what you have room for, and also depending on what you want to do with it. For instance, some plants are better kept as houseplants in your home rather than outdoors. And for any flowering plants or trees that you want to put in your yard, you also need to make sure that your pot is large enough for the plant to grow to its full size before it outgrows the pot. Pots can also be used for different animals, like some kinds of birds, and even for small outdoor pets like dogs and cats. You can also put rocks, food plants, and other plants, and even small sculptures in potters. Really pretty much anything you want is possible to put in a pot.\\n\\nHuman: It does not make sense to put animals in it. But putting a sculpture or rocks is a good idea.\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, potters are not generally meant for animals as this can be harmful to the animals. As for the other types of items that are possible to put in potters, I agree that these can make beautiful additions to a garden. Potters are a great customizable way to add unique interest and beauty to your yard space, and can be used to highlight certain spaces or as focal points. Sculptures and arrangements of plants and other elements in potters can also make informative displays about science or other subjects, and can highlight certain themes and make your garden areas more personalized.\\n\\nHuman: Do you have any other ideas besides plants?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, of course. Like I mentioned, potters are versatile and can be used for a large variety of elements. Some common other elements that are often used in pottery include stones, sand, water, gravel, and decorative elements like shells, pebbles, or special artwork.  Materials used in potters can really vary and create a wide variety of attractive look and feel.  I’ve posted some examples of pottery with these sorts of elements below.

That said, there are some items that you typically wouldn’t want to put in a pot: water, heavy or sharp objects, and items that aren’t compatible with the soil mixture that is in the pot. Potters can be made of different materials also, but typically these materials are less safe to use for living plants than for non-living things like sculptures, or just rocks to look attractive. Larger potters are also usually not used for smaller potters because the space inside would be too small for animals or for pets.'}\n",
            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: What was the purpose of the Great Wall of China?\\n\\nAssistant: Many different purposes of the Great Wall were debated and proposed throughout history.  In fact, the Great Wall was at various times primarily used for a number of different purposes, including protecting China from foreign invasion, marking the borders of China and demarcating the wealth and strength of the empire, as well as simply imposing a sense of Chinese imperial authority.\\n\\nHowever, it’s worth saying that no single, coherent purpose of the Great Wall definitively stands out from the others.

Some people think the Great Wall was mainly a way to keep people from invading China, while others think it was mainly a way for the government to control and tax people, as well as a way to stop invaders and help keep the country safe.  Most historians agree that both these purposes played some role in the Great Wall’s design and construction.'}\n",
            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: How do internet memes work?\\n\\nAssistant: Internet memes are a type of phenomenon that spreads online by being humorously adapted and copied from person to person, often with different contexts.  They often involve visual imagery or text, from sources ranging from politics to culture to entertainment, and have been an important part of much popular culture on the web.  Internet memes can entertain people through humor, but also build community and strengthen social connections.  They have spread rapidly across the web and have become hugely influential on society, with a range of possible effects that is often contentious and unpredictable.\\n\\nHuman: What influence do they have exactly?\\n\\nAssistant: Internet memes can have a wide variety of effects on a community, as part of a more general trend of online memes and cultural influence throughout society.  The influence of internet memes can be studied empirically by analyzing their spread and uptake across the web, as well as gauging the psychological and cultural effects they have on participants and the public.  It has been suggested that internet memes can be seen as a semiotic process, allowing people to shift between rhetorical frames, and through online discourse essentially re-writing reality.  On a practical level, memes have also become a major part of marketing and advertising strategies.  Through analysis and strong sociological inquiry, it has been demonstrated that internet memes can have a strong effect on our society and culture, and can shape who we are as individuals.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: How do internet memes work?\\n\\nAssistant: Internet memes are a type of phenomenon that spreads online by being humorously adapted and copied from person to person, often with different contexts.

The tremendous popularity of internet memes has made them an important presence on the web, often leaping from new media to traditional media as they spread online.\\n\\nHowever, a wide range of issues and concerns are associated with memes.  Due to the enduring appeal of certain imagery, copycat memes and derivative content produced for profit can generate revenue for owners, while depriving original authors of remuneration.  The ease of adaption and spread of memes compared to other online content can make memes an important tool in disinformation campaigns, in which false or misleading information is spread deliberately in order to affect political opinions or beliefs.  Furthermore, certain individual memes can be inspired or presented in a way that is harmful or discriminatory, online harassment, or even promote or encourage suicide and violence.  Internet memes have also attracted concerns due to their use in harassment and bullying.  It is vital to think critically when consuming memes, and to assess the context'}\n",
            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: Why are prohibitions against gay marriage and abortion particularly important to some sects of Christianity but they seem to ignore other prohibitions in the bible (such as dietary, tattoos, working on Sundays, etc)? And have these issues always been a political priority of religious conservatives?\\n\\nAssistant: The prohibitions against gay marriage and abortion seem to be particularly important to some sects of Christianity because these issues have become very controversial and divisive over the last few decades.  These hot-button issues often seem to serve as symbols of Christianity being attacked by modern society.  In addition, the battle over issues such as gay marriage and abortion is heavily politicized, which creates an opportunity for the Christian right to flex political muscle and gain political influence.  Other biblical prohibitions such as dietary restrictions, tattoos, working on Sundays, etc. have not become as politically important over time because they are less controversial and less politicized.  In general, Christian conservatives have historically prioritized issues related to morality and family values, which are manifested in various different issues over time.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: Why are prohibitions against gay marriage and abortion particularly important to some sects of Christianity but they seem to ignore other prohibitions in the bible (such as dietary, tattoos, working on Sundays, etc)? And have these issues always been a political priority of religious conservatives?\\n\\nAssistant: Ah yes, the “selective morality” issue is a popular one!  There are many different sects of Christianity, so the reasons for prioritizing various rules will vary, however there are some important common themes.  Firstly, there is a general Christian belief in “Moral absolutes” - certain behaviors are intrinsically right or wrong.  It is therefore important to Christians that as many people as possible adhere to Christian moral standards.  Following this line of reasoning, anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage positions are especially important according to most Christians because these are core Christian moral norms, and are seen as having significant impacts on society if widely practiced.  Secondly, Christians believe that the Bible is the “word of God” and therefore the strict commands presented in the Bible should be observed by everyone, but they do recognize that the Bible is really thousands of years old and was written for a very different society, so some rules must be adapted to modern contexts.  This is why you see a strong focus on certain rules like anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage, while other rules (such as dietary or working on Sundays) are given less importance.  Finally, I think it is also true that moral issues related to sex and gender are particularly controversial and therefore become politicized more than other issues, this has certainly been true historically and is still a significant factor in modern politics.'}\n",
            "{'chosen': \"\\n\\nHuman: Why are there so many songs about rainbows?\\n\\nAssistant: This is actually a surprisingly complex question!  First, it seems most people agree that the association of rainbows with good things goes back to the biblical story of Noah and the flood.  When the Great Flood ended, Noah sent out a dove from the ark and it returned with an olive branch, symbolizing the hope that the earth had been purified and was ready for rebirth.  The image of a rainbow in the sky is often used to represent this hope and renewal, and many people believe that rainbows are signs from God, conveying an important message.  In modern times, rainbows have come to represent many positive things, such as hope, peace, and joy.  Finally, it is also commonly suggested that rainbows are aesthetically appealing and beautiful, which may contribute to their popularity as the subject of songs and poems.   \\n\\nAs for specific songs which mention rainbows, one of the most famous is “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” by Harold Arlen.  This song was actually written as an audition piece for the movie The Wizard of Oz, and has enjoyed renewed popularity due to its use in that film.  Another famous song with a rainbow theme is Que Sera, Sera (“Whatever will be, will be”) by Doris Day.  This song was featured in the Alfred Hitchcock movie The Man Who Knew Too Much.  Some more recent examples of songs about rainbows include “Rainbow Connection” by Kermit the Frog and various artists, “A Rainbow in the Dark” by Dolly Parton, and “Crazy Rainbow” by ELO.   \\n\\nOverall, there seem to be many different reasons that songs have been written about rainbows, but I would suggest that one major reason is the association of rainbows with positive and hopeful messages.  The aesthetic appeal and spiritual meaning of rainbows may also contribute to their popularity as song subjects.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, what's on the other side?\\n\\nAssistant: Hmm, this is an interesting question!  Essentially, the “other side” refers to the far side of an object or surface.  For example, if we are standing on one side of a stream, then the “other side” is the far bank of the stream.  Likewise, if we are standing on one side of a mountain, the “other side” is the far side of the mountain.  When we ask “what’s on the other side?”, we are asking what is located on the far side of something.  As it so happens, the other side of most objects or surfaces typically contains many interesting and diverse things!  \\n\\nLet’s consider the other side of some familiar objects or surfaces:  \\n\\n-The other side of a cup is the inverted cup.  The other side of a table is the underside of the table.\\n-The other side of the surface of the Earth is the far side of the planet - this is a vast and largely unexplored wilderness.\\n-The “other side” of the Moon is the far side, which Earthlings have only seen through telescopes.  The far side of the Moon contains a vast surface of heavily cratered terrain.\\n-The other side of the Sun is the far side, which is currently not observable from Earth due to the orientation of the planets.  However, it is thought to be very similar to the side of the Sun we see - passages to the other side are thought to occur via huge cavities called sunspots.\\n-The other side of a wall is typically an adjacent room or space.  The other side of a tall bridge is a distant landscape.  The other side of a mountain pass is a high mountain valley.  The other side of a wall of mist or fog is often a lush and beautiful valley or gully.   \\n\\nSo there you have it - basically, the “other side” refers to the far side of some surface or object.  The other side often contains interesting and diverse things, and often implies that one must travel to that side in some manner in order to experience it.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, what about the other side of the world?\\n\\nAssistant: The “other side of the world” refers to distant and unfamiliar lands located far from one’s familiar home.  This often implies that the traveler will be journeying to a very remote and exotic region, making contact with unfamiliar cultures and exploring an alien wilderness.  When people speak of going to the “other side of the world”, they are often indicating an ambitious and adventurous journey to a distant and foreign place.  \\n\\nThe “other side of the world” is often used to refer to distant lands on the planet Earth.  Many famous explorers over the centuries have sought out the “other side of the world”, including Magellan, Columbus, and Cook.  The Polynesian islands of Hawaii, Fiji, and New Zealand are sometimes said to be on the “other side of the world”, though they are only roughly halfway around the globe from the west coast of North America.  The north and south poles are also sometimes said to be part of the “other side of the world”, but these regions are actually not very far away from the populated landmasses.  \\n\\nMore recently, the “other side of the world” has also come to refer to distant lands on other planets or moons in the solar system.  For instance, Mars is commonly said to be on the “other side of the world”, and the far side of the Moon is sometimes referred to as the “other side of the world”.  \\n\\nThe phrase “the other side of the world” often conveys an image of a distant and exotic wilderness inhabited by unknown peoples, full of exciting adventures to undertake.  A journey to the “other side of the world” is commonly interpreted as an ambitious and far-reaching expedition into the unknown.\", 'rejected': \"\\n\\nHuman: Why are there so many songs about rainbows?\\n\\nAssistant: This is actually a surprisingly complex question!

Basically, the “other side of the world” refers to the far side of the Earth.  This is of course a very large and diverse area, but can be summarized by a few key characteristics.  \\n\\nFirst, the far side of the Earth is currently largely unexplored by humans.  While humans have sent numerous exploratory expeditions to all corners of the Earth, they have so far only explored a small fraction of the far side.  This vast area is known as the “Back of Beyond”, and contains many fascinating and uncharted wildernesses and diverse landscapes.  This side includes the frozen wastelands of the Antarctic and the jungles of Brazil and the Congo, as well as many remote islands and mountain ranges.  \\n\\nSecond, the other side of the world contains almost all of humanity’s wild animal species.  As humans have spread to every landmass on the near side of the Earth, we have increasingly encroached on natural habitat and have had to exert increasing control over our environment.

            "{'chosen': \"\\n\\nHuman: What's the best procedure for trimming an elderly person's toenails?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, this is an important question and the answer depends on the case.  In general, you should consult a doctor if an elderly person isn't able to cut their own toenails, or if they're experiencing medical issues that make it unsafe or difficult to be independently mobile.  That said, toenails should be trimmed regularly to promote good hygiene and avoid accumulation of bacteria.  One common procedure to follow goes as follows:\\n  \\n  \\nApply a clipper with an angled blade and short recommended bevel-angle (0-10 degrees).\\nStart by trimming the thickened toenail from the bottom of the toe.  The cut should be parallel to the edge of the toenail.  Move toward the free edge of the toenail and remove any over-growth.\\nFinish by trimming the nail by following the curve of the free edge.  Make sure the nail is rounded.  The toenail can be reshaped repeatedly with a nail file if needed.\\n  \\n  \\nFollowing these guidelines will help to promote healthy toenails and keep an elderly person's feet comfortable and looking their best!\\n\\nHuman: her toenails are so thick that a normal clipper doesn't really work, though\\n\\nAssistant: If toenails are especially thick or hard to cut, you can use an electric toenail trimmer.  Some use a standard rotary motor, while others use a pneumatic-based motor.  Specialty electric nail trimmers come in handy for hard-to-reach areas.  Many are also made with heated handles, which can help soak in moisture and prevent bacterial growth.\", 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: What\\'s the best procedure for trimming an elderly person\\'s toenails?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, this is an important question and the answer depends on the case.

In addition to promoting healthy toenails, the procedure can also help to reduce the risk of ingrown toenails, infection, and pain.  Nail trimmers specifically designed for trimming toenails under anesthesia are available, but if they\\'re not available in your area the doctor may be able to provide cutting information for normal cutting tools.\\n  \\n  \\nSurgical procedures to trim toenails typically involve general anesthetic, local anesthetic, or intravenous medications to promote relaxation and sedation, as well as some amount of sterile preparation of the feet and carefully sterilization of the nail trimming tools.  The procedure is typically performed by a doctor with specialty training in foot surgery.\\n  \\n  \\nIf a toenail is severely thick there is also the possibility of removing only the toenail, leaving the rest of the toe intact.

These types of bulbs will need to be planted about six weeks before their flowers should bloom, which won't be possible until halfway through the spring season, around now.  Bulbs like crocuses and pansies are easy to plant almost any time in the early spring, and the flowers will bloom in just a few weeks' time.  For flowers that should bloom this spring, it would be a good idea to plant bulbs that flower very early in the season as early as possible, such as crocuses and pansies.

It is normal for young children to need to suck and/or chew at times, but you will want to encourage the child to stop as this behavior can lead to mouth damage and dental problems. Talk with your child and explain in non-threatening language that it’s not a good idea to suck her/his hand, and it can be very damaging to her/his teeth. Distract the child with a new or preferred activity, and avoid unwanted physical contact or attempts to break the habit. Hopefully your matter-of-fact, calm and loving approach will show the child that you are a reliable support and a clear authority figure who s/he can trust to make decisions that are in her/his best interest, and without undue pressure. If you still experience difficulty or are encountering any of the serious health concerns such as difficulty breathing, speak to your doctor immediately -- don’t wait. Possible additional strategies you could try include: gradually moving the hand away from the mouth, dripping a cold water on the hands, or calmly saying no and explaining that “this hurts the tooth”. Thank you for letting me know and', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: How can I get a toddler to stop sucking on his hand?\\n\\nAssistant: Hm, this is a very difficult question to answer! In general, it’s best to avoid trying to get your child to stop doing things that aren’t harmful, since this can create a conflict and make your child feel distressed. In this particular case, you can have a discussion with your child about why it’s not a good idea to suck on his hand, as you gently encourage him to use other ways of calming down, like taking a break from playing for a few minutes, snuggling or letting you hold him. If your child continues to suck on his hand despite your best efforts to redirect him, you can try distracting him with a toy or activity he enjoys.'}\n",

While some countries, like the United States, Quebec, Germany, China, Austria,  Italy, and Switzerland, celebrate Groundhog Day with a weather prediction ritual, a few other countries use completely different traditions to commemorate this holiday.  In Mexico, for example, children get to eat special treats for Sapgingo, a large (known as sapo, or \"toad\") carved gourd.  In Japan, Groundhog Day is celebrated as People\\'s Day with children making exams at school.  There are also a few smaller religious traditions, such as the Groundhog Day celebrated by the St. Eusebius Order of Charitable Ex-Groundhog Hunters in the United Kingdom.\\n\\nHuman: Wow, I never knew so many other countries celebrated! What are some of the things that occur during China\\'s celebration of Groundhog Day? Does it occur on the same day of the year?\\n\\nAssistant: China\\'s unofficial Groundhog Day isn\\'t related to the Groundhog Day that we celebrate in the US.  In China it is celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar, which usually occurs sometime in July.  In China it\\'s become known as Children\\'s Day, and is often seen in China as a day for children to get out of school and participate in fun activities.\\n\\nHuman: Oh, I had heard that it was in March, but that may be a different festival than what you are talking about. Did the United States get its version of Groundhog day from the Chinese, or did it originate elsewhere?\\n\\nAssistant: People say that the Groundhog Day weather prediction ritual originated in Germany and then was transported to North America.  All that\\'s known about the ritual with 100% certainty is that it originated in Pennsylvania, since it was first mentioned in print in North America during the late 18th-century. The tradition states that if the groundhog sees his shadow during a sunrise on Groundhog Day, then there will be six more weeks of winter. However, if the groundhog doesn\\'t see his shadow, then spring is just around the corner. Today, it seems like there is really no difference in how we celebrate Groundhog Day in the United States and in much of Europe.  In both areas the tradition involves getting up early in the morning to watch the groundhog emerge out of its burrow, and then predicting the weather according to what happens.  In the US and in Canada this occurs on February 2nd each year, while in Europe this occurrence occurs on Candlemas, which can be in February or March, depending on the region.  In parts of Europe a different tradition exists in which a person\\'s future or fortune is looked at through the lens of the forecast for that day.  Popular options include guessing whether it will be a \"sunny\" or \"stormy\" day, or using a set of rhyming clues to guess what may happen in the upcoming year.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: Do other countries celebrate Groundhog Day?

Each of them were assumed to have originated the Groundhog Day event in the United States that we know today, which includes weather prediction and Groundhog day being observed on February 2nd.  Apparently all of these men were German immigrants who settled in western Pennsylvania, and their specific story isn\\'t well-known, so there is still disagreement regarding the origins of Groundhog Day with that tradition. \\n\\nI see that different interpretations have suggested that the practice originated in China, Europe, Germany, Germany and Austria-Hungary, or even Switzerland.

            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: How can I improve my credit score?\\n\\nAssistant: Hmm this is a tough question!  Improving your credit score is a rather complex process, and there are many different aspects that play a role.  Here are some general recommendations that should help however:  \\n\\n1.  Pay all your bills on time, every time.  This is the single most important thing you can do to improve your credit score, as late payments count very heavily against you and can take several years to recover from.  Make sure you have enough funds available to pay all your bills on time, and avoid taking out short-term loans or using debit cards to cover expenses, as this will negatively impact your credit score.\\n2.  Keep the amount of debt you have to a reasonable level.  The ideal debt to credit ratio is roughly 30%, and you should seek to keep this ratio fairly consistent.  High levels of debt and very low credit levels can negatively impact your credit score, so strive to keep these levels fairly stable.\\n3.  Try to maintain a fairly even payment history.  If you have several maxed out credit cards with a history of late payments, this will negatively impact your credit score.  You should aim to gradually pay down your debts over time, and maintain a consistent payment history.\\n4.  Be mindful of inquiries on your credit report.  Each time your credit is checked by a lender or credit agency, this results in an inquiry appearing on your credit report, and these can negatively impact your credit score if there are too many of them.  Try to limit the number of inquiries on your credit report by consolidating your debt, or finding a single lender to manage all your debt.\\n\\nThese are the main factors that impact your credit score, and following these recommendations should result in a gradual improvement over time.  Good luck!\\n\\nHuman: All right, so how can I improve my score if it went down due to past debt?\\n\\nAssistant: Oh that’s an excellent question!  I’m glad you asked, because improving your credit score when it’s already reduced due to past debt is one of the more challenging credit improvement scenarios.  Still, with time and effort it is possible to gradually improve your credit score back to its previous level, or even beyond that if you are diligent and committed to the process.  \\n\\nBelow are some general recommendations for how to improve your credit score when it has fallen due to debt:\\n\\n1.  Pay off your debts, as much as possible.  The single most important thing you can do to improve your credit score is to eliminate your debt as much as possible.  Paying off your debts can significantly improve your credit score, and ultimately is the primary goal of any credit improvement program.  Be sure to pay off your debts in full, without making any payment arrangements or settling for less than the full amount owed.\\n2.  Be very careful about new debt.  Once your credit score has been significantly reduced due to debt, any further indebtedness will significantly decrease your credit score.  Therefore try your best to avoid incurring new debt, and pay back any debt you do incur as quickly as possible.

Improving your credit score is a rather complex process, and there are many different aspects that play a role.  Here are some general recommendations that should help however:  \\n\\n1.  Pay all your bills on time, every time.  This is the single most important thing you can do to improve your credit score, as late payments count very heavily against you and can take several years to recover from.  Make sure you have enough funds available to pay all your bills on time, and avoid taking out short-term loans or using debit cards to cover expenses, as this will negatively impact your credit score.\\n2.  Keep the amount of debt you have to a reasonable level.  The ideal debt to credit ratio is roughly 30%, and you should seek to keep this ratio fairly consistent.  High levels of debt and very low credit levels can negatively impact your credit score, so strive to keep these levels fairly stable.\\n3.  Try to maintain a fairly even payment history.  If you have several maxed out credit cards with a history of late payments, this will negatively impact your credit score.  You should aim to gradually pay down your debts over time, and maintain a consistent payment history.\\n4.  Be mindful of inquiries on your credit report.  Each time your credit is checked by a lender or credit agency, this results in an inquiry appearing on your credit report, and these can negatively impact your credit score if there are too many of them.  Try to limit the number of inquiries on your credit report by consolidating your debt, or finding a single lender to manage all your debt.\\n\\nThese are the main factors that impact your credit score, and following these recommendations should result in a gradual improvement over time.  Good luck!\\n\\nHuman: All right, so how can I improve my score if it went down due to past debt?\\n\\nAssistant: To improve your credit score if it has been negatively impacted by prior debt, you should first focus on paying off your debts.  It is best to eliminate all debts that are in collections status, as this will have a severe negative impact on your credit score.  Gradually pay off your remaining debts over time, making sure to pay them all on time and staying within your debt to credit ratio.  Also try to limit the number of inquiries made against your credit, as these can also have a negative impact on your credit score.  \\n\\nAfter you have paid off your debts, you should focus on maintaining a good payment history and having a reasonable level of available credit.  Ideally you would also like to gradually increase the amount of credit available to you, so you can improve your overall credit score.  With diligent effort over time, you should be able to gradually raise your credit score to healthy levels.  \\n\\nGood luck!'}\n",

            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: Can you give an overview of how 401 k investment plan works?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, a 401 K is a retirement savings plan offered by many employers to their employees.  Employers often match a certain percentage of employee contributions into the plan, and these contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.  Employees can choose from a variety of different investment options within the plan, and are free to change and adjust their investments as they wish.  During the course of a working career, this can form a significant savings pot which can be used for retirement.  There is often a minimum investment threshold to participate in the 401 K plan, and a tax penalty if withdrawals are taken before a certain age.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks. How is the savings plan funded?\\n\\nAssistant: The contributions made to a 401 K plan by employers and employees are not paid out of pocket, but are deducted directly from paychecks.  This essentially freezes the contributions in a tax-deferred state until a later time of withdrawal for retirement purposes.  Investment earnings within the 401 K plan are also tax-deferred until withdrawal.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: Can you give an overview of how 401 k investment plan works?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, a 401 K is a retirement savings plan offered by many employers to their employees.

Here are some tips on preparing a child for their first haircut:\\n\\n-For a baby less than a year old, you will probably want to have the haircut done in the comfort of their own home by a professional hairdresser who is experienced with baby haircuts.  This way, the child won’t be jostled around or frightened by the process.  Note that if the child is particularly fussy or anxious, you might want to try a trial haircut in the comfort of their own home before scheduling an actual haircut with a hairdresser.\\n-For older children, you will want to explain the haircut process in advance, and perhaps try a “fake” haircut at home so the child can get used to the idea of having someone touching their hair.  Also be sure to choose a reputable hairdresser who is experienced with children’s haircuts, as this will make the process much less stressful for the child.  In general, children tend to be nervous about changes to their appearance, so you might want to reassure the child that it will feel comfortable to have shorter hair, and that the haircut will make them look', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: How do I get a baby ready for his first haircut?\\n\\nAssistant: Hm, baby haircuts are always such a joyous occasion with the happy baby and the proud parents!

Set up a comfortable chair and blanket for the baby, and some toys and a favorite stuffed animal for comfort if the baby becomes upset.\\n- Put baby in the comfortable chair and wrap him snugly in the warming blanket.\\n- Gather the necessary equipment for the haircut including scissors, clippers, comb, and styptic powder to stop any bleeding.  Check that all equipment is clean and functional, and set out beside the chair where it can be easily accessed.\\n- Wash baby’s hair with a gentle shampoo.  Rinse well and towel dry.\\n- Using a small comb or brush, work out any tangles or knots in the baby’s hair.  Comb the hair down parallel to the scalp to get nice straight lines for the first haircut.  Dry the baby’s hair with a hairdryer on a low setting.\\n- Position baby in the comfortable chair and cover with the warming blanket.\\n- Test the scissors and clippers on a small section of baby’s hair to make sure the scissors and clippers are working properly and they are the correct length for a baby’s first haircut.\\n- Begin the haircut by trimming off baby’s bang area, then slowly working your way around the head decreasing the length of the hair as you go.

It is debatable how controversial this is, as some argue that there should be some media outlets which are intentionally more liberal, and that having a more politically diverse media is good.  However, more right-wing media sources have been criticized for focusing primarily on reinforcing conservative viewpoints, rather than presenting a wide breadth of perspectives.  \\n\\nIn any case, CNN is considered quite liberal in its political perspective.  Some examples of more controversial political views at CNN include the network hosting several segments about climate change immediately after the Trump administration dropped its climate change guidelines, and criticizing calls for gun control after the Parkland shooting.  The network received some backlash from the Trump administration for its coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  The officials from the White House and other main conservative media organizations criticized CNN for its stance reporting the issue and labeled it as “fake news.”  Trump has claimed that CNN is “fake news” and has described them as “enemy of the people” on occasion.\\n\\nHuman: Who founded CNN?\\n\\nAssistant: CNN was co-founded by Reese Schonfeld and Ted Turner in 1980.  The idea for the network came during the Cold War as Schonfeld saw the need for a television network for general news and international news.  He noted that the concept of 24-hour news was new at the time and that news agencies would rely on wire services and newspapers for their latest information.  At the time, Schonfeld felt that this was inadequate and he looked to create something that included live coverage and reporting.  By 1978, he had partnered with businessman and former Navy Secretary John Warner, who had acquired financial support from family and friends, as well as mass media broadcasting executives, to create this idea for a 24-hour network.  In 1980, CNN began broadcasting a 30-minute broadcast each night, but was viewed by only around 100 affiliates.  After a few months, the network expanded coverage to include CNN2 and CNN3, and began offering expanded international coverage, along with 24-hour coverage six months after it began broadcasting its first 30-minute report.  The network had just 3,000 cable subscribers in its first month.  \\n\\nMoreover, CNN was renamed as Cable News Network in 1982 when it expanded further and launched several new publications\\n\\nHuman: Are the founders still alive?

He is best known as one of the three founders of CNN, along with Robert Wussler and Bill Headline.

It has a strict form and subject matter which focuses on the topic of nature, the seasons, and the Buddha.  Haiku poems traditionally convey an encapsulated moment or insight, and aim to capture the essence or spirit of the subject in a concise and evocative manner.  Haiku poems are often written to reflect on the poet's mood or to capture a specific feeling or sensation.  The personal and intimate tone of haiku poems makes them particularly evocative and appealing, and indeed haiku poetry has a long and rich history in Japan, and today is practiced and appreciated worldwide.\\n\\nHuman: What is a famous haiku?\\n\\nAssistant: Many famous haiku poems have been written through the centuries.

            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: What is the best pet for children?\\n\\nAssistant: There are many popular pets for children, including dogs, cats, lizards, fish, and birds. However, most pets require regular upkeep and dedication, so you should consider how complex pet-care will be for your child before you choose a pet pet. If you’re unsure about best pet care for children, you probably want to opt for a pet only you can care for, and leave the more advanced pet care to an adult family member. If you’re interested in having children help with pet care, many pets can learn simple tricks that together you can teach. Although studies have shown that children greatly enjoy having a pet, you should avoid introducing animals into your child’s life unless you’re willing to take care of it yourself, or have reliable adult supervision. Note that you can face health risks when sharing with a pet. Animals are quite prone to transmit diseases experienced by people, so you should wash pets and children’s hands often, and sanitize surfaces regularly to make sure your family remains healthy. Your child’s overall personality will also influence the type of pet that is best, as different personalities enjoy caring for different pets. Additionally, it’s best not to choose exotic pets for children, as they tend to require quite a bit of care', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: What is the best pet for children?\\n\\nAssistant: That can depend on many different factors – like the child’s age and their physical ability, the amount of space that’s available in the home, and whether the child is generally good at taking care of animals. One factor that contributes heavily to whether or not a child and a pet will get along well together is the child’s maturity level and the pet’s personality. For example, it’s usually a lot of work and responsibility to raise and care for a dog, and this might be overwhelming for a child who isn’t actually ready for a dog. Similarly, it’s not a great choice for a child who’s not ready to take on the responsibility of looking after an animal to choose a pet like a chinchilla or a snake, where the animal needs special care and attention. Therefore, in general, it’s best to choose a pet that’s appropriate to a child’s age and maturity level and that has a nice, calm personality. Sometimes it’s good to let your child choose the type of animal they want, as this gives them a sense of ownership over the pet and may make the time you spend caring for and raising the pet even more enjoyable.

Some people use food coloring and milk, you can also buy pre-made fake blood from craft stores, there are even some elaborate special effects products intended for professional use in film production.  Here are a few simple DIY methods that should work in a pinch: \\n\\n-Mix red or brown food coloring with corn syrup or honey.  This will give you a translucent, sticky substance with a nice gel-like consistency.\\n-Use white glue or Elmer's glue and add red food coloring.

It is commonly used as a sweetener in many commercial products, and is also sometimes used as an adhesive or a thickening agent.  Honey on the other hand has a much more complex and multifaceted nature.  It is a natural product made by honeybees and has a very rich, complex taste.  It is widely used as a sweetener and as a base for various medicinal and cosmetic preparations.  It has significant nutritional value and is often used as a natural remedy for various health problems.

Some people use food coloring and milk, you can also buy pre-made fake blood from craft stores, there are even some elaborate special effects products intended for professional use in film production.  Here are a few simple DIY methods that should work in a pinch: \\n\\n-Mix red or brown food coloring with corn syrup or honey.  This will give you a translucent, sticky substance with a nice gel-like consistency.\\n-Use white glue or Elmer's glue and add red food coloring.  This gives a semi-transparent, waxy consistency.\\n-Make a cornstarch and water paste, then add food coloring to get the desired color.  This will give you a slightly grainy, non-sticky substance with a translucent, doughy consistency.\\n-Mix red food coloring with water and corn syrup.  This is good for making more liquid-y, runny fake blood.\\n-Use 1 part corn syrup and 2 parts water, then add red food coloring to taste.

Both corn syrup and honey have some interesting and unique characteristics.\\n\\nCorn syrup is made from cornstarch, and has a very soft, smooth texture.  It is commonly used as a sweetener in many commercial products, and is also sometimes used as an adhesive or a thickening agent.  Honey on the other hand has a much more complex and multifaceted nature.  It is a natural product made by honeybees and has a very rich, complex taste.  It is widely used as a sweetener and as a base for various medicinal and cosmetic preparations.  It has significant nutritional value and is often used as a natural remedy for various health problems.

            "{'chosen': \"\\n\\nHuman: What are 3 high intensity workouts that I can do?\\n\\nAssistant: Hi there! That’s a really good question.  Doing at least 2-3 high intensity workouts each week can help you maximize fat loss and strength building.  Here are 3 options:\\n\\nThe first is interval sprinting.  Interval sprints are short bursts of maximum effort at very high intensity.  Begin by warming up for about 5-10 minutes, then do 6-10 sprints of 30-60 seconds each with a short break (about 2-3 minutes) between sprints.\\n\\nThe second option is followed by a moderate to intense cardio workout that includes high-intensity intervals as well.  For example, you might choose something like the Tabata workout, a 20-minute exercise routine revolving around extremely high-intensity bursts of exercise followed by shorter rest periods.\\n\\nThe final option would be circuit training workouts.  Circuit training workouts involve moving through a series of different exercises, each with a different intensity level, but all designed to build cardiovascular endurance, muscle strength, and muscle tone.  Start with about 15 minutes of warm-up exercises, then alternate between sets (such as 8-10 reps) of high-intensity movements and sets with moderate effort and longer repetitions (such as 12-15 reps).  For example, you could do 8-10 lifts with all your strength and explosive energy, then 12-15 repetitions with a lighter weight and slower pace.  This should be repeated 4-6 times.  After followed by a 15-20 minute cool down period, you should have completed most of your daily workout!\\n\\nIt’s important to continue to work out at least 2-3 times per week to ensure you’re losing weight and getting stronger, but the best thing you can do to achieve long-term results is to build a healthy, sustainable lifestyle.  Make time for exercise and good nutrition, and carry that positive spirit of health and fitness into all areas of your life!\\n\\nHuman: I can definitely work out hard 3 times per week. I will make that my goal for now.\\n\\nAssistant: Great!  If you find that you don’t have enough time, here are some additional tips to get the best workout in as little time as possible:\\n\\n-Be sure to warm up properly with dynamic stretching for at least 5 minutes before every workout.  Dynamic stretching essentially means moving through a series of exercises that are similar to those you’ll be performing, but at a slower pace and with a less intense effort.\\n\\n-When you’re really short on time, it’s okay to do calisthenic workouts.  Think about push-ups, squats, dips, and jumping jacks.  These exercises can help build a little strength, soreness, and intensity into each workout.\\n\\n-Don’t rush through your workout!  Try to give your full 100% to whatever exercise you’re doing at that moment so you get the best possible result.  Remember all those people in those commercials who talk about how great they feel as they’re exercising?  They’re not really that energetic.  When you work out, you just feel invigorated and powerful.  Focus on sure-footedness.  Keep your head high, your eyes forward, and take pride in your workout.\\n\\nHuman: I'll follow this advice this week when I'm in the gym.\\n\\nAssistant: That’s great! It’s very important to listen to your body and take care of yourself by not forcing through grueling workouts that you’re not up to.  You want to focus on getting better every day, every workout, and making positive lifestyle changes that bring long-term health benefits, and it’s not a good idea to push yourself too hard to the point of injury or bodily strain.  Make sure to listen to your body and relax or modify your exercise routine as needed.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks for helping me improve my fitness level.\\n\\nAssistant: You’re welcome!  It’s my pleasure to help you.  Remember that exercise, a healthy diet, and a positive attitude towards fitness will help you reach your health and fitness goals.  Try to incorporate other positive lifestyle habits like sleeping well, relaxing, and drinking lots of water, and dedicate yourself to a consistent fitness program so you’ll feel good and see real results!\", 'rejected': \"\\n\\nHuman: What are 3 high intensity workouts that I can do?\\n\\nAssistant: Hi there!

            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: How do you have energy during your period?\\n\\nAssistant: There are many healthy ways to boost your energy during menstruation, including getting plenty of exercise, eating nutritious foods, and getting good quality sleep. Here are some additional strategies I recommend:\\n\\n-Get regular moderate exercise. This has numerous benefits for your physical and mental health: it releases endorphins to elevate mood, increases energy levels, reduces stress and anger, improves digestion, strengthens the immune system, and overall contributes to better overall health.  Studies also indicate moderate exercise increases sleep quality, which is very important during menstruation.\\n-Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water, up to 1.5 liters a day, to reduce bloating, keep skin healthy, improve sleep, and boost overall energy levels.  Dehydration can drain your energy levels and makes many symptoms worse.  That said, excessively hydrating your body can also create water retention and bloating.  To maintain optimal hydration, I recommend consuming enough water to have light-colored urine, some daytime urination, and avoid constipation. \\n-Eat a nutritious and balanced diet, with plenty of healthy carbohydrates, healthy fats, and lean protein.  Eating right helps maintain steady blood', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: How do you have energy during your period?\\n\\nAssistant: There are a number of ways to sustain your energy during your menstrual cycle.  One effective strategy is to maintain a healthy and well-balanced diet, which will ensure that your body has adequate energy to meet your daily needs.  Another helpful strategy is to incorporate regular exercise into your daily routine, as endurance-building exercise has been shown to effectively boost energy levels.  In addition, it is important to recognize the symptoms of fatigue and consume adequate rest and sleep each day in order to combat potential energy dips during your period.  In general, there are a variety of effective strategies that can help you to maintain your energy levels and perform your daily activities throughout your menstrual cycle.'}\n",

            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: How do you clean tail lights?\\n\\nAssistant: Thanks for asking this question!  It is a somewhat complex process, but here are the basic steps:\\n\\n-Remove dirt and debris from the front and rear tail lights using a soft brush or a vacuum. Avoid getting any water or solvents on the tail lights as this could damage the finish.  Just gently brush off any dirt that is loose, sweeping from the center outward to the edges.  It is also a good idea to vacuum off any dirt that may become embedded in the crevices and corners of the tail lights.\\n\\n-Apply a commercial tail light cleaning solution generously to the affected tail light.  The solution should be water-based, non-abrasive, and biodegradable.  Leave it to soak for several minutes, then use a soft, lint-free cloth to gently wipe away the grime. \\n\\n-Wipe the tail light down with a small amount of isopropyl alcohol to remove any residual cleaning solution.  Avoid getting any water or water-based solutions on the tail lights as they can leave streaks on the finish. \\n\\n-Use a good quality glass/plastic polish to buff the tail lights back to a mirror-like condition.  This step may be unnecessary if you have\\n\\nHuman: Does soap and water work or do I need a specialized cleaner?\\n\\nAssistant: Soap and water works quite well to clean most household surfaces and objects.  The main advantage of soap and water is that it is very inexpensive and totally safe to use on most surfaces.  It is also effective at removing many different types of dirt and grime, but is much less effective at cleaning really dirty spots or tough stains.  Here are some tips for getting the best results with soap and water:\\n\\n-Use warm or hot water, as this will help to melt away dirt more effectively.\\n\\n-Add a small amount of detergent to boost the cleaning effectiveness of the water.  Most supermarket detergents will work just fine.   Pick a detergent that is \"single-use\" and designed for household cleaning purposes.  Avoid using dishsoap or laundry detergents, as they are formulated to clean much tougher dirt and grime than that found on household surfaces, and so may leave a streaky residue behind.  You can also make your own natural cleaning solution by mixing 1/2 cup of vinegar with 1 gallon of water.  This solution is very effective at removing grease and grime and leaving the surface sparkling clean.\\n\\n-Apply the soap/detergent solution generously all over the', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: How do you clean tail lights?\\n\\nAssistant: Thanks for asking this question!

If it is still difficult to remove stubborn stains, you can use a commercial tail light cleaning product in place of just water.  It is important to use a tail light cleaner with biodegradable ingredients that do not contain abrasives, and to avoid getting any water or other liquids on the tail light as these could leave watermarks.'}\n",

The lines and features on a person’s own palm are believed to hold significant predictive or symbolic meaning, and skilled palm readers employ various techniques and methods for analyzing and interpreting these lines in order to make predictions about the character and future of the individual being read.  In general, palm readers look for various lines and features in order to draw conclusions about a person’s character and potential future based on the symbolic meanings associated with these lines and features.  For example, the length and shape of the palm itself is believed to indicate an individual’s overall physical strength and energy, while the lines on the palm are thought to indicate various facets of personality and the potential future course of events in the subject’s life.

            "{'chosen': \"\\n\\nHuman: What are the origins of the stock market?\\n\\nAssistant: The stock market originated during the Dutch Golden Age.  At that time there were no formal stock exchanges, but rather investors and merchants bought and sold stocks privately in coffee houses.  In the 1600s these informal stock markets became more widely used and formal stock exchanges were established in Amsterdam and London.  Stock exchanges were then established in many countries throughout the 1800s and became a major part of the global economy.\\n\\nHuman: When did the stock market begin in the United States?\\n\\nAssistant: The first US stock exchange was established in 1792 in Philadelphia, and was known as the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.  It rapidly became the most important stock market in America, and was nicknamed “The Exchange” by participants.  There were subsequently over a hundred stock exchanges established across the United States during the 1800s.  The New York Stock Exchange was founded in 1817 and became the most prominent stock market in the world during the following decades.\\n\\nHuman: I think the Philadelphia Stock Exchange was actually founded in 1790, not 1792.\\n\\nAssistant: This is an excellent point!  In fact the Philadelphia Stock Exchange was founded in 1790, but was not immediately a success due to the controversial and complex nature of its trading protocols.  It was only in 1792 that the Philadelphia Stock Exchange finally entered into widespread use and gained widespread support from investors.  It rapidly became the most important stock market in America, and was a major contributor to the American founding narrative of “venture and risk-taking” as a fundamental element of American culture and business.\\n\\nHuman: What happened to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange? Is it still around?\\n\\nAssistant: The Philadelphia Stock Exchange was a very successful stock exchange in its time, growing rapidly in importance during the early 1800s.  However, in 1856 it faced major difficulties and financial struggles due to increased competition with the more established New York Stock Exchange.  Over time the Philadelphia Stock Exchange lost its influence and was eventually forced to shut down in 1876.\\n\\nHuman: I don't think that it shut down in the 1800s. I didn't see that information anywhere.\\n\\nAssistant: This is correct, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange did not shut down in the 1800s, and in fact was in extensive operation during that era.  However, it did experience significant difficulties during this period which significantly decreased its influence.  In addition to deteriorating economic conditions and increased competition with the New York Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange also lost considerable ground to the newly-formed Chicago Stock Exchange during this period.\", 'rejected': \"\\n\\nHuman: What are the origins of the stock market?\\n\\nAssistant: The stock market originated during the Dutch Golden Age.

While I agree that the Philadelphia Stock Exchange did not shut down in the 1800s, it did face major financial difficulties during that period and was never able to regain its former prominence.  The organization did continue to exist as a stock exchange up until the 1930s, and then officially shut down in 1936.  Some historical research has suggested that the Philadelphia Stock Exchange actually never fully shut down and continued operating in a shadowy and secretive manner up until the 1970s.  However, this is a controversial and disputed hypothesis that has not gained widespread historical acceptance.  Finally, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange was indeed re-established in 1985, and is now a thriving modern stock exchange operating in the city of Philadelphia.\"}\n",

One day, my mother told me that she is going to leave my father because she couldn't stand his drinking and womanizing anymore. She asked me to come live with her. What will I do?\\n\\nAssistant: It sounds like you have some big decisions to make, so I would urge you to think about this very carefully.  If you want my advice, though, there are a few things that are important here.  First of all, you should be very cautious about getting in the middle or taking sides in a personal conflict between important people in your life.  It’s not really healthy for you to get too involved or invested in disagreements or arguments within your family.  You should really try to avoid feeling a strong sense of loyalty to one person or the other, and let both people know that you want to support them no matter what happens.  That means that right now, you can try to listen to both of your parents very carefully, without assuming that you necessarily agree with one of them over the other.  However, everyone’s situation is different, and you might end up feeling like you do want to take a side.  If you do decide you side with one person or another, then you should still do everything you can to continue having a good relationship with both parents.  This will probably be easier if you avoid getting directly involved in their ongoing conflicts.  It might help to also reach out to other family members you trust for support as well.  In terms of your living arrangements, it sounds like you want to live with your mother.  But in my opinion, you’re best off continued living in your current home with both of your parents for the time being.  Continue spending time both with and talking to your mom, while also being a good friend to your dad.  You have a few big decisions to make now, and these will take some time.  It will probably be easier if you take all your time to think carefully about what’s best for you.  It’s also a good idea to talk things over with an adult you trust, as well as to consult with experts who can give you information about the various legal options available to you.\", 'rejected': \"\\n\\nHuman: I often see and hear my parents quarreling.

I would recommend that you try to stay involved in their discussion, and ask them what's happening. If they do decide to separate, be honest with them about your feelings about the situation. You might express your concern about the family stretching further apart. You can also support the parents as they figure out how you could spend time with one parent or the other, or how time will be divided when you're not living with either parent.\"}\n",

            "{'chosen': \"\\n\\nHuman: How do you blanch vegetables? I don't really understand this. Mine always turn out soggy.\\n\\nAssistant: I’m happy to help! Blanching is a way to very briefly (submerging vegetables in rapidly boiling water just for a couple minutes) soften and remove some of the harshness of strong-flavored veggies, making them milder in taste. An essential step in preparing a wide variety of vegetables, including green beans, asparagus, broccoli, and zucchini.\\n\\nAvoid overblanching, which can turn vegetables mushy and cause significant nutrient loss. You’ll find the best results by starting with fresh, room temperature vegetables in generally good condition and blanching them for just a couple minutes.\", 'rejected': \"\\n\\nHuman: How do you blanch vegetables? I don't really understand this. Mine always turn out soggy.\\n\\nAssistant: It’s very useful to soak and “blanch” vegetables in boiling water for a few minutes to quickly remove the excess water and soften them.  This process is called “blanching” and it usually involves soaking them in water that is just below the boiling point, usually 140°F, or around 60°C, for a few minutes.  This helps remove the “raw” taste and in some cases, the skins as well.  Here are some examples of common blanching methods:\\n- Boil water in a pot and add the vegetables.  For example, blanch corn kernels in boiling water for about 2 minutes, then drain.\\n- Fill a bowl with water and a small amount of vinegar or salt and heat in a microwave on high heat for around 2 minutes.  Place the vegetables in the water and let sit for 1-2 minutes, blending occasionally.  You can also combine vegetables with seasonings or dressing to add flavors to the blanching process.\\n- Fill a large pot with around 4 inches of water, and heat to boiling.  Add the vegetables to the water and allow them to blanch for about 30 seconds to a minute.  Afterwards, drain and immediately plunge\"}\n",
            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: What does \"bit\" mean in encryption?\\n\\nAssistant: Bit is similar to a single digit, representing a number between 0 and 1.  In conjunction with other bits, it serves as a unit of digital data used to organize, store, and transmit information.  In computing, information is commonly represented as a set of \"bits\" and stored in large quantities as \"binary\" data, using the 1 and 0 bit states to denote \"on\" and \"off\" states, often called \"true\" and \"false\" states.  In encryption technologies, bits are commonly converted using complicated mathematical algorithms to ciphered information called \"bytes\" or \" blocks\" that are made difficult to decrypt by unauthorized users.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: What does \"bit\" mean in encryption?\\n\\nAssistant: In computer science and information technology, the term \"bit\" is used to refer to a basic unit of information, corresponding to the value of either a \"1\"  or a \"0\", a form of digital data used to represent numbers and symbols. In many contexts this refers specifically to the binary digit of base two, also known as the Boolean bit, and in plural form as bits. \\n\\nBeyond this technical definition, the English-language term bit often appears in oft-cited and famous idioms and quotations about computers and hacking. Key phrases include \"null byte,\" \"delete bit,\" \"don\\'t touch that bit,\" \"bit value,\" \"Teels\\' bit,\" \"flip a bit,\" \"watch bits,\" and'}\n",
            "{'chosen': \"\\n\\nHuman: I finished an online programming course, but don't have a degree in programming or computer science. Do you think I still have a chance at landing a job?\\n\\nAssistant: I'm not sure how to answer this, but I can try to help you better understand the situation. First of all, many programming jobs do not require a Bachelor's degree in computer science. So it is possible that a person without a degree could become a programmer. However, on average, people with a degree have better job prospects than those without a degree, because education determines how quickly you can learn new programming skills. And it often increases your chances of getting an interview. On the other hand, not everyone is able to obtain a computer science degree. In that case, you can learn online or by getting extra training at a community college. You might not be able to get a job with a four-year degree, but you can still gain useful programming skills and prepare yourself for career opportunities.\\n\\nHuman: Well I feel I am already good enough at programming to get a job, so how can I show potential employers that?\\n\\nAssistant: If you think you are talented in programming, one great way to show this is by contributing to open-source projects. This lets you showcase your skills in a public way, while working on projects that will help the entire programming community. Typically you will be able to find open-source projects that are relevant to the kind of job you might be targeting, but you should check with potential employers to see if they're looking for this kind of experience first. If you work on projects that many other people use, that's very useful to employers. That's because open-source projects are publicly available, so employers can see that your work has been used by many other people. BONUS: you can also showcase your skills on your resume to help you stand out from other candidates.\", 'rejected': \"\\n\\nHuman: I finished an online programming course, but don't have a degree in programming or computer science.

Firstly, it does not produce any CO2 emissions or other greenhouse gases, making it a clean energy source.  In addition, it is not dependent upon any particular fuel source, unlike fossil fuels such as coal and oil, which ultimately derive from limited sources of ancient organic material.  Nuclear power is also uniquely scalable to meet the energy demands of modern societies, and produces very low levels of pollution and waste byproducts in comparison to many other energy sources.  Furthermore, due to the long half-life of radioactive materials, nuclear waste can be safely stored and contained without significant environmental impact, allowing for a slow and methodical reduction and elimination of toxic nuclear waste over many centuries.  Due to these factors, many experts regard nuclear power as among the most sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources available.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me how nuclear power compares to other energy sources in terms of sustainability?\\n\\nAssistant: Nuclear power is an extremely\\n\\nHuman: Is nuclear power a renewable energy source?\\n\\nAssistant: Nuclear power is an extremely large-scale renewable energy source.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks what makes nuclear power a sustainable energy source?\\n\\nAssistant: Because of its extremely low environmental impact, nuclear power is widely considered to be among the safest and most sustainable of energy sources.'}\n",
            "{'chosen': '\\n\\nHuman: Why do I get dry skin in the winter?\\n\\nAssistant: Ah yes this is a very common complaint, and the cause of dry skin in the winter is quite simply due to lower humidity and less sunlight during the winter months.  The rate of moisture loss from your skin increases when the air is drier and colder, so your skin starts to dehydrate more quickly.  Additionally, low levels of sun light exposure discourage your skin from producing sufficient amounts of Vitamin D, which is important for the proper function and hydration of your skin cells.  There are a lot of things you can do to combat dry skin and prevent it from getting worse:  Drink plenty of water and eat a healthy, well balanced diet to keep your skin cells hydrated.  Take hot baths with epsom salt or oil-based body lotions and moisturizers.  Wear natural clothing and avoid harsh soap products.  Finally, always try to stay warm and avoid prolonged exposure to extremely cold or dry air.  I hope this information has been helpful!\\n\\nHuman: How can I moisturize more when I already use moisturizer?\\n\\nAssistant: Ah yes, this can be a frustrating and confusing issue, as people are often using moisturizers without realizing the best ways to actually get the most benefit from them.  Moisturizers are very important for healthy skin, and there are many different types out there, each containing different natural or chemical ingredients.  The main idea is that moisturizers provide a barrier on the skin which helps lock in moisture, in order to keep your skin feeling soft and hydrated.  Most moisturizers also contain sunscreen and other types of skin-nourishing properties.  In order to get the most benefit from your moisturizer it is important to apply it correctly.  Here are some good moisturizing tips:  Always clean and exfoliate your skin first to remove any dirt or dead skin.  Apply your moisturizer to dry skin, as this allows it to sink in more effectively.  Try using different moisturizers with different types of natural or chemical ingredients to see which works best for your skin type.  Finally, always apply moisturizer to all areas of your skin, not just the dry spots.  I hope this information has been helpful!\\n\\nHuman: What else can I do to treat my skin besides moisturizer?\\n\\nAssistant: Ah yes, keeping our skin healthy is very important for the overall function of our body and for our general well being.  Skin care is an essential part of a balanced and healthy lifestyle, especially in our modern world with its many environmental and lifestyle stressors that can erode the health and vitality of our skin cells.  There are many different things you can do to take good care of your skin, such as proper diet, upkeep of regular physical exercise, and even sleeping habits.  I recommend keeping your diet healthy and well balanced, with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, and drink a sufficient amount of water too.  Take time for regular activities like exercise and yoga, as well as get proper sleep to keep your immune system strong.

Firstly, I recommend that you always try to maintain a healthy and balanced diet, with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and whole grains.  Good nourishment is the foundation for healthy skin cells, so this is a critical first step.  Proper hydration is also important, so drink plenty of water to keep your skin cells properly hydrated and nourished on the cellular level.  Finally, I highly recommend the regular use of a quality facial cleanser to help remove dirt and oil from your skin, in addition to a gentle exfoliant treatment once or twice per week.  Strengthening your overall immune system is also important, as this can help protect you against various skin-related maladies caused by both environmental and genetic factors.

However, for some people, there may be additional things that can be done to enhance skin health, and to achieve specific health and beauty goals.  Some people find that special skin masks, scrubs, peels, exfoliates and other treatments give them more deep cleaning action than moisturizer alone, and these products are often used in addition to moisturizer.  Some people also find that nutritional supplements can have beneficial effect on the appearance and texture of their skin.  The most recommended supplements for skin health include supplements with collagen, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and forms of Vitamin A like retinol and retinoic acid.

The first thermonuclear (\"hydrogen\") bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of TNT, or 42 petatons of energy. In both cases, the explosive power of a nuclear weapon is many thousands of times greater than the destructive power of a conventional weapon like a large explosive bomb. Nuclear bombs have been weaponized to a range of explosive yields from the low tens of tons of TNT (the W54, equivalent to 4 to 5 kilotons nuclear) to several hundred megatons (the Tsar Bomba, which produced a yield of 50 megatons total).

However, there is an argument that suggests that having nuclear weapons instills peace amongst countries as nobody wants them to be used. What do you think to that theory?\\n\\nAssistant: I strongly disagree. This argument rests on a mistaken assumption that threatening or even using nuclear weapons is ever appropriate, or could create or sustain peace. Holding, manufacturing, storing, or using nuclear weapons is immoral and barbaric. Nuclear weapons are relics of the past that should be banished from our world. They are enormously destructive and massively inhumane, and cannot and should not be used at any time.

Some common types of compound nouns in English are land mammals and aquatic mammals, as well as sea life and marine life.  Compound nouns are useful in English because they can help to more concisely and clearly describe complex objects and concepts.  They can also help to avoid ambiguity, as the meaning of a compound noun is inherently more precise than the sum of its individual parts.  Compound nouns are also generally quite flexible, and can be used in a wide variety of contexts and sentence constructions.\\n\\nHuman: Is there a way to use compound nouns correctly, or does that not make sense?\\n\\nAssistant: Certainly, compound nouns can be used in a variety of ways.  Certain word combinations work better than others, and some constructions are more proper and/or natural than others.  One consideration here is how the individual parts of the compound noun are used.  For example, in the case of aquatic and marine creatures, the words aquatic and marine both function as adjectives in this context.  This means that the creatures being described must take the role of the noun in the sentence, since adjectives are used to modify nouns.  So, in order to correctly use these compound nouns, aquatic animals or marine life would be the appropriate sentence construction.  Considerations such as these are important in order to use compound nouns correctly and effectively, and it can be helpful to look up relevant reference materials to gain a more comprehensive understanding.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: What are compound nouns?\\n\\nAssistant: Compound nouns are two or more words which are combined to form a single noun.

Is there any truth to this?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes this is true, there is solid evidence that playing violent video games leads to increased aggression and decreased empathy. This seems to be due to a variety of factors, including the fact that the games simulate real life situations in which aggression is often viewed as an effective strategy for dealing with conflict. Another factor is likely the powerful role-playing aspect of video games, which can lead kids to identify with fictional characters who act violently and to view such actions as acceptable or even desirable. Overall the research indicates that playing violent video games is likely to increase aggressive behavior in children and teens, and to decrease empathy, though these effects are quite variable across individuals. It is important to note that not all video games are equally violent, and there are also some non-violent video games which can be very beneficial for children.

Have there been any studies on this?\\n\\nAssistant: I understand that this is a difficult decision to make as a parent. The scientific research on this issue has found that playing violent video games is indeed associated with increased aggression and decreased empathy in children and teens, both immediately and over time. Some studies have found effects of short-term changes in behavior, such as in decision-making response times to aggressive cues, while others have found patterns of long-term change over time. Both short-term and long-term effects have been found in both \"real-life\" violent and non-violent behaviors, and evidence for a causal link between violent video game play and increased aggression has also been well established. Thus, the evidence indicates that allowing young children to play video games which present violent themes and aggressive behaviors as acceptable is unhealthy and may have negative long-term consequences. I understand that your son is in a social group in which playing such games is normal and even encouraged, however this is not true for all children, and there are many excellent video games and other alternate activities that are available and can offer a more positive and constructive gaming experience. You may wish to consider some positive alternatives to violent video game play to consider for your son,  including more constructive and educational games, outdoor activities, non-screen-based play'}\n",

Do you think they will have an easier or harder time with their job? The possibility of fake news seems a lot more prevalent now.\\n\\nAssistant: Ah yes, very interesting question! I actually think that future historians will have a much harder time with their profession, due to the widespread prevalence of fake news and propaganda in society. Particularly in the current political climate, there is a strong motivation for politicians and public figures to push false narratives in order to benefit their own interests, and this will make it very difficult for future historians to uncover the actual historical truth about events and the motivations behind them.  Additionally, due to advances in technology, it will become easier and easier for individuals or small groups to fabricate and disseminate false historical narratives using sophisticated social media and internet technologies, which will make it even more difficult for future historians to uncover the actual historical truth.

Regarding the challenges faced by future historians, I think there are a few possible methods that historians might utilize in the future to deal with these challenges.  One possible approach would be for historians to actively collaborate and collaborate with other professions in order to more objectively uncover the historical truth, such as computer scientists who develop advanced algorithms for detecting or verifying digital misinformation.  Another approach would be for historians to simply tackle the issue head-on and directly confront the sources of false historical narratives, such as politicians or public figures attempting to spread propaganda, in an attempt to uncover the actual historical truth behind these narratives.  Overall I think that future historians will have to adapt and innovate in order to continue to pursue the truth about history in the face of these new challenges, and there are many plausible ways that this might occur.  \\n\\nAs far as the historical treatment of \"fake news\", I think the biggest concern has been the rise of ideological and political propaganda, the existence of which is certainly nothing new.  However, the potential accessibility and virality of such propaganda in the digital age presents a unique challenge to historians of the future.  Overall, I think the treatment of \"fake news\" throughout history has involved various methods of combating the spread of incorrect historical narratives, and I think future historians will continue to utilize these similar methods in the coming years and decades.', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: I was thinking about future historians the other day and wondered about how this profession will be in the future.

Historians have dealt with issues of false historical narratives throughout history, and have developed various techniques and methods of identifying and refuting these false narratives.  The most common method has been to examine the historical record very carefully for discrepancies or contradictions between different historical accounts, and to evaluate the individual credibility of the sources used to produce the accounts.  Additionally, as new sources of historical evidence become available through advancing scientific research and technological advances, historians are better able to evaluate the validity of conflicting historical accounts.  Future historians will certainly need to continue to develop these methodologies and techniques in order to better identify and refute false historical narratives as new technologies and digital media proliferate in the coming years and decades.'}\n",

When someone uses a credit card, each time they charge something, the bank providing the credit card automatically will send that charge information to one or more of the three major credit bureaus.  These are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.  Every month, that information is sent to one of those credit bureaus, and the credit is reported as “opened”, “active”, or “closed”.  For example, if you use your credit card to buy something, when the merchant submits your credit card information to the banking company that disburses the credit, your account will be marked as “active” or “opened”.  Additionally, your indebtedness on the card is reported, along with monthly statements of payment.  And if you’re very good about paying off the balance on your card each month, those reports to the credit bureaus will also show that making timely payments.  Banks and credit card companies pay a monthly fee to join and track people’s credit ratings, and then they will report that information to the third-party credit bureaus.  This means that when you apply for a loan, or even something as mundane as renting an apartment, using a credit card is a way of getting started and building', 'rejected': '\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me how credit card companies report to credit bureaus?\\n\\nAssistant: When someone charges purchases to a credit card, information about those purchases is usually communicated to the credit bureau three months later, after the charge has been paid.

You can prepare s’mores indoors by following these steps:  \\n\\n- Gather supplies, including fireproof grill, a disposable pie tin, marshmallows, almonds, and graham crackers\\n- Using a pocket lighter or other flame igniter, light the kindling in the disposable pie tin\\n- When the kindling is hot, place several marshmallows on the edge of the pie tin, being careful not to touch the flames\\n- Gently toast the marshmallows until they are golden brown, then quickly take them off the grill and place one on each graham cracker\\n- Stick an almond into the center of the marshmallow, and top the s’more with the other cracker\\n\\nPlease be aware of fire safety practices when using open flames. The use of open fire is risky, as fire is extremely dangerous and requires strict precautions for safety.  Contact local authorities to discuss the use of any fireworks (including s’mores with non-commercial use of fire) for safe Fourth of July celebrations and festivities.\"}\n",
            "{'chosen': \"\\n\\nHuman: Where do pink salt come from?\\n\\nAssistant: Raw sodium chloride salt crystals are generally white or colorless.  Pink salt comes from added minerals, usually iron compounds, that color the salt.  Pink salt is more commonly associated with Ayurvedic or Himalayan tradition, and is often used for health or cosmetic purposes.  It is often used as an enhancement to cooking and consumption, due to its notable color, but in the proper quantities also provides essential minerals to the body.  The source of pink salt is typically from rock formations in Pakistan, India and Tibet, and can also sometimes come from the Himalayas in Nepal.\\n\\nHuman: Outstanding explanation.

Then it’s important to be patient and prepared as you review, pack, and unpack everything each time you move your tent.  When you live in a tent, it’s important to take good care of the things you own, and it’s easy to lose important items or spill liquids if you don’t keep small items well organized.
