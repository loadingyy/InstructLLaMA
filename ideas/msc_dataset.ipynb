            "Answer: I would love that. I love iced coffee so much.\n",
            "Question: I bet you drink a lot of coffee with 3 kids! How old are they?\n",
            "Answer: Haha yes I have to or i'll go crazy. My girl is five and the boys are seven and ten. They are growing up so fast.\n",
            "Question: I can imagine. I feel like it was just last week that I brought home Toby from the shelter. Now he's fat and old and just lays around staring at birds.\n",
            "Answer: Haha that's such a mood!! I bet he's the coolest. \n",
            "Question: He's a pretty great cat. Do you have any pets? I bet your kids would love a new kitten or puppy!\n",
            "Answer: I've been thinking about it for a while. I was thinking maybe a dog or a fish. But hearing about your cat I kind of want one for my kids now haha.\n",
            "Question: Cats are the perfect pet, especially with kids. They are low maintenance, don't have to go outside for walks or to use the bathroom, and they love to cuddle. I can recommend a good shelter if you're in the market! What do your kids want?\n",
            "Answer: Yes I will take the recommendation. You're right about cats, I love that they are sassy most of all lol. My kids just want something new in the house, they don't care what honestly.\n",

            "Answer: It is.  But you have to watch out for everyone else on the road more than in a car.  How do you like being a waitress?\n",
            "Question: I'm sure it's a lot more dangerous than driving a car but the thrill could be worth it. I like me job during slow days and hate it during busy shifts. \n",

            "Answer: Amazing. Are you vegetarian or vegan? \n",
            "Question: No I couldn't do it, I would miss my regular burgers too much. Especially if they're anything like the ones I just had.\n",
            "Answer: That's fair. Though my family is vegan, I am actually vegetarian. I just love cheese too much!\n",
            "Question: Cheese is my favorite food! That's exactly why I love burgers so much. I do respect veganism, but just couldn't do it.\n",
            "Answer: How is your cat doing? What colour is he/she?\n",

            "Question: I did! Can't believe Brady has another win! Although, the amount of penalties those refs were calling did seem a bit one-sided! Did you?\n",
            "Answer: I did watch it although I don't know much about football I enjoyed watching it. How many superbowl trophies does Brady have? It's something absurd like 8 isn't it?\n",
            "Question: This is his 7th win, 10th time making it to the Superbowl. I had to call out of work so I wouldn't miss it! Hope I don't get fired. Do you know when the next season of the Walking Dead is starting? I started reading the comics and kinda like it. Have you read the comics too?\n",
            "Answer: Wow that is a lot of wins! I don't know when it starts but I can't wait!! I am so excited to see what happens. I haven't read the comics! I am afraid if I read the comics I won't like the show as much. Have you ever seen an episode or just read the comics?\n",
            "Question: I've only read a few of the comics so far. Not sure when I want to start the series, maybe when I'm caught up a bit and can compare the books and the shows. Maybe I'll binge it! Any snack suggestions?\n",
            "Answer: It's always dangerous to watch a show based on literature in my opinion! They never can get it quite right. I have been eating a lot of Poppables chips and hummus! I love those chips they are light and airy. Whats your favorite snack?\n",
            "Question: This is true. Sometimes I really hate it when they change the story for the shows/movies. That sounds delicious! Is pizza a snack? I could eat it all days. Maybe I'll pick up some bagel bites. Ever tried those?\n",
            "Answer: haha, yes pizza counts as a snack I think. Especially leftover pizza. I haven't tried them but they look good and bite sized! I need to pick up some guacomole. That's another favorite snack of mine. \n",
            "Question: Yes! Thanks for the reminder. I love spicy guacamole the most. Of course, I can't forget snacks for Gandalf too, he loves to sit me with and watch shows.\n",
            "Answer: That sounds like a very nice time. If I had a dog it would probably be addicted to junk food too! Have you eaten blow pops before? I have been eating a ton of those lately, too.\n",

            "Question: I am sorry! I hope things pick up. No I haven't. Right now I am just taking some time to self-reflect. I don't know if my industry is right for me. Are you passionate about making video games?\n",
            "Answer: Yes I love making video games. My friends and my mom tell me I have great ideas for video games. I just need some work experience. How has your last week been?\n",
            "Question: Yeah, getting your foot in the door is always rough! My week has been nice. I just went to the lake and fished. I caught a huge fish and drew it. What did you do this week?\n",
            "Answer: I ran some errands for my father. He has helped me get by while I get my feet under me. I've never fished, how long have you been a fisher?\n",
            "Question: Wow that's very kind of him. Parents are great! I have been fishing for 15 years if you can believe it! Do you have any interest in fishing? I could teach you.\n",
            "Answer: Yes I actually need a hobby. Do you have a boat?\n",
            "Question: I would love to teach you!! I do have a boat. It's not very big but it does the job. Do you get seasick? \n",
            "Answer: Well, I don't know actually. There's only one way to find out if I get sea sick. It sounds like it will be fun.\n",
            "Question: I will make sure to bring some medicine. Sea sickness is not very fun!! I bet you would love being on the water. It's so relaxing\n",
